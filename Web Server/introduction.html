                My name is Vincent. I am from Smoky Hill High School and also taking a class at 
                Cherry Creek Innovation and a class at Cherry Creek Elevation.
                I am currently taking 4 AP classes and my favorite classes are math, which is calculus for me, and
                cybersecurity class.
