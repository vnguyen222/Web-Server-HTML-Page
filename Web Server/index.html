            <div class="textFormatting infoSection">
                My name is Vincent. I am from Smoky Hill High School and also taking a class at Cherry Creek Innovation Campus and a class at Cherry Creek Elevation. I am currently taking four AP classes and my favorite classes are math, which is calculus for me and cybersecurity class. I like programming and plan to be a computer science major in the future. My favorite programming language is C++ and Java is starting to grow on me.

            <h5 class="infoHeading">WHY I CHOSE THE PICTURE</h5>
            <div class="textFormatting infoSection">
                I chose the above picture/gif because it describes how I am going fast all the time and trying to complete everything in a good and, sometimes, cool fashion. It also elaborates on the fact that I am busy and always doing something.
